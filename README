# NBA Data Scraper and Analyzer

## Description
This project is a Python-based tool to scrape, clean, and visualize NBA player 
statistics. You can choose a range of seasons starting from 1951 to present. The tool 
retrieves data from the NBA's official stats API, and generates interactive 
visualizations to help understand trends and changes in the game over time.
